      engines usually allow content to be written using a simplified markup
      language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor.[2]
      There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and
      part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines
      are open-source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over
      different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may
      permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access
      without enforcing access control. Other rules may be imposed to organize
      content. There are hundreds of thousands of wikis in use, both public and
      private, including wikis functioning as knowledge management resources,
      note-taking tools, community websites, and intranets. Ward Cunningham, the
      developer of the first wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, originally described
      wiki as "the simplest online database that could possibly work".[3] "Wiki"
      (pronounced [wiki][note 1]) is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick".[4][5][6]
